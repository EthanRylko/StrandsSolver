# Strands Solver
By Ethan Rylko

I try to solve the NYT Strands with a bot. Uses Python, Selenium, and nltk for now.
You need to install Selenium and nltk via pip if you haven't already.

## Requirements
If you do not already have the required packages, run:
```
pip install nltk
pip install selenium
```

## Chromedriver
You also need a Chrome driver so Selenium can work automatically.

I hope you already have Chrome.
